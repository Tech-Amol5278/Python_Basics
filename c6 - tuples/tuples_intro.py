# tuple data structure 
# tuples can store any data type 
# most imporatant is tuples are immuatable, it cant be changed once created 

# example  = ('one','two','three')
    # # no append, no insert , no pop, no remove 

# For better practice, should be used only if we know, data is not going to change

# Why to use tuples:
    # faster than lists

# Methods 
    # count, index 
    # len function
    # slicing
